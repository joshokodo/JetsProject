## Week 2 Homework: Jets Project

### Overview
This program was assigned to test and practice our knowledge on the 4 pillars of object oriented programming using "jet" objects with different characteristics. By using inheritance and polymorphism, we can see that sub classes of a jet can behave differently.

#### Operation/Description of how the program works:
This program continuously asks for commands from the user through 
a menu interface and performs actions involving a fleet of Jet objects.
Each input is error checked via menu interface. After each command, data is printed
to the screen. A special command "Add jet to fleet" lets you add a custom built jet
to be added to the AirField object.All data output will be printed followed by the menu.

#### Technologies/Techniques Used

| Technologies/Techniques |
| ----------------------- |
| Java               |
| Inheritance        |
| Polymorphism       |
| Abstraction        |
| Encapsulation      |



#### Lessons Learned
- The use of TDD and a finished UML could have organized the process and I might have 
been able to add extra features.


#### Problems/Issues
- No serious problems but found myself refactoring alot. 


#### Stretch Goals
- I wanted to make some sort of game with the jets fighting with stat points and resources
